# A very simple chess engine

The goal of this project is to write a chess engine that can routinely beat me at
chess (probably not that hard, if I were to guess at my ELO rating I would say around
1200-1500 would be pretty accurate).

Because of this, the engine will not be the pinnacle of chess engineering and is
more a foray into chess programming than anything else. Basically, just a toy engine
that I may one day turn into a low level lichess bot.
